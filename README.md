üëã Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer. I have 7+ years of experience in iOS App developement. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

# [AI-Handy](https://www.ploonet.com/son)

(Contract Work) - New Zealand
- I've have the opportunity to contribute to this incredible iOS VOIP & AI App. Using SwiftUI, I've helped full phase developement from scrach to build in designs, implement a VOIP calling feature and AI layer with WKWebview to talk with AI, and help with various bug fixes and launch app to app store.
Is this amazing and smart secretary who reads my missed calls while I'm driving, talks about restaurants, weather, and other things, records phone calls, and writes down the contents of my phone calls, only the CEO of a large company can hire this? Just sign up and you can get hired right away!
